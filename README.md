# Background

This 1 day short course is designed to provide the participant with a basic set of tools to undertake research using R. Rome wasn't built in a day, and R can't be taught in a day. The aim is to create a strong foundation on which participants can build skills and knowledge specific to their research objectives.

The course makes use of the authors' experiences of working with R for data-science and statistical analysis. However there are many other resources available, and we would particularly recommend the freely available content at *[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)* as a good place to recap the materials taught in this course. The hard copy of Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's book of the same name (and content) is available at *[Amazon.com](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)*. Alternatively, a user guide is available on the CRAN R-Project website [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html), although the author finds this less easy to follow than Hadley Wickham's book described above. Further details of where to go to answer more specific questions are provided throughout the course.

# Who are we:

Rob, Paul & Sarah work at the intersection between public health, economics and data-science. They are all based at the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield. Rob and Paul are joint funded by the Wellcome Trust Doctoral Training Centre in Public Health Economics and Decision Science [108903] and the University of Sheffield.

*[Robert Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-smith-53b28438/)* joined ScHARR in 2016. His research focuses on the methods used to estimate the costs and benefits of public health interventions, with a specific interest in microsimulation modelling in R. He has become increasingly interested in the use of web based user interfaces (in R-Shiny) to make research more transparent and to aid decision makers. While doing his PhD, Robert has been involved in multiple projects with the World Health Organization and parkrunUK.

*[Paul Schneider](https://bitowaqr.github.io/)* joined ScHARR in 2018. He is working on conceptual and methodological problems in valuing health outcomes in economic evaluations. A medical doctor and epidemiologist by training, he has used R in various research projects, ranging from the modeling costs of breast cancer, and value of information analyses, to the monitoring of influenza in real-time using online data. He is a keen advocate of open science practices.

*[Sarah Bates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-bates-647ab9145/)* joined ScHARR in 2016. She completed her PhD in Public health economic modelling in 2021 and has been a Research Associate in ScHARR since then. Sarah has a background in Health Psychology and Health economic modelling. She has used R for various projects with expertise in microsimulation modelling and is particularly interested in the challenges of modelling health behaviours and behaviour change.
