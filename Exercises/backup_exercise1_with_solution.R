# Exercise 1 

## R as a fancy calculator

## Use R to answer the following questions for you:  

#### 1.1 what is 1+1
1+1

### 1.2 What is 3 times 17 ?
3*17

### 1.3 Create an object d equal to 10.
d = 10

### 1.4 Divide d by 5.
d/5

### 1.5 Overwrite d, let it now be equal to 20, and ???print??? d, to see the results
d = 20
d


### 1.6 Overwrite d (which is now 20) with 4 times d, and print d top see the result
d = d * 4
d

# 1.7 Overwrite d (which is now 80), with d times d, and print the result
d = d * d
d

### 1.8 Create a new object A and set it equal to 3
A = 3

### 1.9 Create another new object res, let it be the product of d and A, and output the result
res = d * A
res

### 1.10 Finally, take the average of d, A and res
(d + A + res) / 3
# mean(c(d,A,res))

## Evaluations

### 1.11 Is 4 greater than 2?
4 > 2

### 1.12 Is 5 less than 3?
5 < 3

### 1.13 Is 6.2 equal to 12.4/2?
6.2 == 12.4/2

### 1.14 Is 5 equal to or greater than 4?
5 >= 4


### 1.15
# I Create an object foo and set it to be 8
# II Create another object bar, and set it to be 7
# III Is foo divided by bar greater than 1.14 ?
foo = 8
bar = 7
foo/bar > 1.14
